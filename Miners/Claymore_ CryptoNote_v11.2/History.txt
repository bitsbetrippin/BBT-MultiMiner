- improved support for EthMan, now all commands are supported.
- now remote management is working in read-only mode by default.

- added HTTP support for remote port.
- added "-retrydelay" option.
- added "-ftime" option.
- a lot of minor improvements.



v9.6
---------------------------------------------------------------------
